_Installation_
Simply do "make install" on a compatible host.

These scripts are based on hostedXen.

Instructions on creating a Debian OpenVZ host are documented at http://openvz.org/Installation_on_Debian .

_NAT_

Something like the following will be helpful for network configuration in /etc/network/interfaces .

auto br
	iface br inet static
	bridge_ports none
	bridge_stp no
	address 10.174.0.1
	netmask 255.255.0.0
	network 10.174.0.0/16
	broadcast 10.174.255.255

_Init_
Run the hovzInit script to initialize the pool of usable IP addresses and CTIDs for new OpenVZ containers.
